            <h1>Final Project! Cat Scheduler</h1>
            <p>
            A clock with time-based prompts that reminds cat-owners when and what to do to help take care of their feline friends! There are prompts such as breakfast time at 8AM, taking your cat for a walk at 4PM, and cuddling with your cat at 6PM. Meow!

            Technical Write-Up:
            For this project, I incorporated three main parts: DS3231 Real Time Clock (RTC), Arduino, and LCD screen. The RTC uses the DS3231 library to track time. The RTC went through an initial setup to program in the real time and date, and a battery was placed inside of it so it was still able to internally track time even when disconnected from the USB port on my computer. Once the time was setup, it communicated to the arduino and time and date were captured into variables to output onto the LCD screen. From there, it was pretty straight forward going through each of the hours of the day and applying if-statements for each hour to accomplish a certain task.
